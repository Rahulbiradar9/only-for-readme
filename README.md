## ✅ **Project Title**

**Smart Crowd Entry & Movement Management System Using Agentic AI and Google Cloud**

---

## 📘 **Project Description**

This project is a smart, scalable system designed to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **respond to crowd movement** using **real-time sensors**, **Agentic AI**, and **blockchain-based audit logging**.

Powered by **Gemini on Vertex AI**, the platform tracks entries, predicts movement patterns, and autonomously takes action (like sending alerts, rerouting people, or locking gates). Data is stored securely, monitored in real-time, and visualized through Firebase and Maps integration.

## 🎯 Optional Enhancement (Blockchain Logging)

To ensure **data immutability and trust**, every critical event (entry, movement alert, gate action) can also be hashed and stored on-chain (e.g., using Polygon or Hyperledger).

> Gemini agents can be designed to also record decisions to a smart contract for audit purposes.

---

## ✅ Next Steps (if you're building it):

1. Set up Firestore + Firebase Auth
2. Build agent logic in Gemini via Vertex AI
3. Configure IoT inputs (emulated or real devices)
4. Deploy microservices on GKE or Cloud Run
5. Connect everything with Pub/Sub
6. Visualize via Maps + Firebase UI
7. Optional: Integrate blockchain logs
